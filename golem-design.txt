Goal - cheat that isn't really a cheat.

Transfer inventory from player.
  - refill empty coal/fuel (no_fuel) add configurable amount (10)
  - refill furnaces source when empty (no_ingredients, use previous_recipe to add ore)
  - remove furnace output when full (full_output)
  - remove "coal" drill fuel when above full (full_output)


Golems are stupid creatures that do mundane tasks that the character does.
It is an early game help.

Tasks:
  - add fuel (coal/wood only) to
    - "stone-furnace"
    - "steel-furnace"
    - "boiler" (higher priority)
    - "burner-mining-drill"
    - "burner-inserter"
  - remove excess fuel from "burner-mining-drill"
    - allows the drill circle
  - remove output from "stone-furnace" and "steel-furnace"
  - bring excess output to character
  - drop non-fuel items in a "golem-chest"

Golem Properties
  - has a "reach distance" equal to the default player (no tech, no mods)
  - will take from and give to player if in range
  - will take from and give to golem chest if in range
  - will walk to a golem chest or player to get in range
  - has an inventory the size of an iron-chest
  - it will try to maintain two stacks of coal
    - excess is given to a nearby player or deposited in a golem chest

Golem Marker (optional):
  - A non-colliding pole that gives a golem a work area.
  - a golem will wander between any markers that are within range of each other when idle

Golem Chest (basic logistics, optional):
  - provider
    - anything in this chest will be remove (low priority)
    - preferred source for items
  - storage
    - dump excess inventory here
  - requester
    - asks for a certain number of items - golem will try to satisfy

Golem Controller:
  - the golem controller maintains a list of jobs (and location)
    - service entity (add / remove fuel, remove output)
    - build ghost
    - provide materials (request chest)

When idle, a golem will grab the first job.
If there are no jobs, it will wait for a fixed amount of time at the current location.
If the wait time expires with no job, it will travel to a nearby golem marker that is hasn't visited recently.
The wait time resets when it tries to go to a marker.
If there are no golem markers that it hasn't visited, it clears its list.

jobs:
  - service entity
    - move to entity location with a range set to the 'reach'

["stone-furnace"]       = { min_fuel = 5, min_out = 1, max_out = 10 },
  ["steel-furnace"]       = { min_fuel = 5, min_out = 1, max_out = 10 },
  ["boiler"]              = { min_fuel = 20 },
  ["burner-mining-drill"] = { min_fuel = 5, max_fuel = 20 },
  ["burner-inserter"]     = { min_fuel = 5 },
