A network check defaults to automatic provider mode.

In automatic mode, it sends everything to the item network.
It tracks which items it has sent to the network in the last 5 minutes.

The global limit is used to prevent adding too many items.

If a limit is hit (can't deposit an item), then:
  - a filter slot is created for every item that has passed through the chest in the last 5 minutes
  - the slots are sorted by the number of items that the item network can accept
  - the bar is set on the first item can doesn't have room.

For example, say we have a chest that has been supplying iron-ore and copper-ore.
If no limit has been hit, then we leave the chest as unfiltered with no bar.
If the item-network can no longer accept iron-ore, then the slot filters are as follows:
  [1] = copper-ore (can still send to network)
  [2] = iron-ore (cannot send)
  [3] = nothing

The bar is set to 2, preventing any iron-ore from being added to the chest OR anything else.

The left-click screen will show something like the following if a limit has not been hit:
"
This chest is in automatic provider mode.
The chest is unlocked and will send all contents to the item network.
It has recently provided the following:
  [iron-ore icon]
  [copper-ore icon]
"
Where the icons are the usual rows of icons, sorted by name.

If a limit has been hit, then the text will show:
"
This chest is in automatic provider mode.
It is currently locked due to:
  [iron-ore]
It is providing the following:
  [copper-ore icon]
  [iron-ore icon]
"


Network Chest Redesign.

- Generic Provider Chest (Bulk)
  Based on the Logistic Storage Chest
   - Single filter to restrict what goes into it. (?)
   - Automatic dump to network if there is room.
   - Manual bar - no automatic support

- Generic Requestor Chest (Bulk)
  Based on the Logistic Requester Chest
   - Requests satisfied from Item Network (also from logistic robots)


 * Buffer is same as Requester
 * Active/Passive provider the same


Sensor support for the Item Network
 Per-item results: 0=no item, 1=below limit, 2=at/above limit
   Iron Chest: 1000 slots to accommodate lots of items.
     - set operable=false
