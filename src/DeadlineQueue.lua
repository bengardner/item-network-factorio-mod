--[[
This provides a deadline queue, where the item is retured at the appropriate
tick or soon after if it has already expired.
Keys must be unique for the item. (entity.unit_number)
Values must be a table. The field "_deadline" is added to the table.

Conceptually, this is an infinite series of buckets with each spanning SLICE_TICKS tick.
The buckets are processed until empty and expired. Then we advance to the
next bucket. The prior buckets are always empty, so they are discarded.

Because "infinite" isn't possible, we use a circular queue of size SLICE_COUNT.
If the deadline for an entry is beyond the last bucket, it is placed in the
last bucket.
The next() function will check the deadline and re-add the entry if its
deadline is beyond the bucket's deadline.
In this way, a tick deadline that is beyond (SLICE_TICKS*SLICE_COUNT) is possible.

There are two modes: Exact and Coarse
Exact mode does what you'd expect. An entry is returned by next() only if it
has expired.

Coarse mode will return any entry from the current slice, even if it has not yet
expired. This is specifically for multi-layer queues.
